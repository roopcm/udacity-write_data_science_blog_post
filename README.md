# Data Science Blog for Udacity Project 

### Medium Blog Post
Here is the Medium blog post I have written: https://medium.com/@roopcm/https://medium.com/p/d3958a436b4c/edit


#### Project Description 
This is the first project in the Udacity Nanodegree program where the CRISP DM methodology is used  to analyze the Seattle airbnb dataset. 
The CRISP-DM methodology has the following stages:
1. Business understanding: 
2. Data understanding
3. Data preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment


### Project Motivation
This project (Write a Data Science Blog Post) is part of Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program.

To showcase a case study, Seattle Airbnb Dataset is used for this project. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, the dataset describes the listing activities of homestays in Seattle, WA. The dataset is posted in this page which can be used standalone with the notebook.

This project focuses on answering following questions:
 1. What are the most occurring utilities in the listings?
 2. Which areas in Seattle have the most number of listings in Seattle area?
 3. How are the listings in different neighborhoods distributed by property type?Â 
 4. What can we learn from the numerical distribution and correlation of the features of the dataset?
 5. Which features in the dataset determines the price of a listing?

# Installation

The notebook requires Python 3 to be installed as well as the following libraries: 
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Sklearn
4. Seaborn
5. matplotlib.pyplot
6. Math

The libraries has been installed through anaconda, a pre-packaged Python distribution.

# Datasets
There are three datasets that have been provided on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle): 
* Listings: This dataset has all the airbnb listings in Seattle and the details corresponding to each listing. 


### File Descriptions
1. Airbnb_Seattle_HomeStay.ipynb
Jupyter notebook with complete analysis, answers to the questions, explanations and visualisations

2. listings.csv
Original dataset in csv format, which has been obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle
